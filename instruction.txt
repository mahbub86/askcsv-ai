✅ 1. 🧳 Prepare Your Project Folder

Your project folder should look like this:

askcsv-ai/
├── app.py
├── agent.py
├── requirements.txt  ✅ (you'll create this)
├── data/
│   └── drc_mv_cfm_stock_of_lmis_2025_06_24.csv
├── tools/
│   └── csv_tools.py


✅ 2. 📄 Create a requirements.txt File

Make a file named requirements.txt in the root with the following content:

streamlit
pandas
plotly
langchain
langchain-community
ollama

👉 If you're using conda or virtualenv, no need to include system-wide packages.
✅ 3. 🧱 Install Python (if not installed)

Download and install Python 3.9+ from:
👉 https://www.python.org/downloads/

During install:

    ✅ Check “Add Python to PATH”

✅ 4. 📁 Copy Project to Other PC

Move the full askcsv-ai folder (with all .py files and folders) to the target PC using USB or shared network.
✅ 5. 🧪 Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

# Navigate to project directory
cd askcsv-ai

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

✅ 6. 📦 Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

    This installs streamlit, pandas, langchain, ollama, and plotly.

✅ 7. ⚙️ Make Sure Ollama is Installed & Running
🔸 On the other PC:

    Download and install Ollama from
    👉 https://ollama.com/

    Open a terminal and run:

ollama run llama3

(You can also use another model like mistral or llama2 if preferred.)
✅ 8. 🚀 Run the Streamlit App

In the same terminal:

streamlit run app.py

It will launch in your default browser at:
👉 http://localhost:8501
✅ 9. 📂 Upload a CSV and Ask Questions!

Use the sidebar to:

    Upload CSVs

    View query history

    Clear history
    Then ask questions like:

    "Show total OrderQty by ProductName"

    "Map of all facilities"
